    //- Add comments to your script to answer the following questions:
// (a) What is the scope of a const variable? The scope of a const variable is block-scoped.

// (b) When were the let and const keywords added to JavaScript? The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), which was finalized in June 2015.
